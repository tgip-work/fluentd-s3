Derivated work from https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/fluentd-elasticsearch/fluentd-es-image
Therefore the container also contains all fluentd plugins that had been installed by the base image.

Base image can be found at https://console.cloud.google.com/gcr/images/google-containers/GLOBAL/fluentd-elasticsearch
